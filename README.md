## Problem Statement: 
During the COVID-19 crisis, as the number of patients was rising exponentially, the unavailability of Beds in hospitals and Oxygen Cylinders caused problems to people, thus risking the lives of the patients. People in need were unable to connect with the people who could arrange or provide the resources. This creates a need to develop a platform for the same.


## Objectives of the Project: 
-	The main focus of the project is to make COVID-19 resources available to people living within reach of the providers.
-	To create one single destination for COVID-19 resources and management of the same with a vision to aid the process of finding Necessitous Resources with less time.
-	To develop a website that will provide a user-friendly interface for people to look for availability and accessibility of Hospital Beds and Oxygen Cylinders. This aims at creating an interface that requires less hectic logging in and going through a whole long process before actually receiving the help.
-	To connect providers/requesters of covid resources with each other using Google Maps API. This would help them contact each other without wasting time and risking lives of the patients.
-	To verify the authenticity of the dealers in order to minimize oxygen cylinder fraud. Authentication is to be done using the registration ID of Oxygen cylinder providers.
